#### Analysis:
The customer demograohics showed that:
- Most of the customers were medium income earners, and only about 5% were high income earners.
- Most of the customers were single which i found very wierd because i expected people to come with their spouses ðŸ˜„
- It showed that most of the customers were students which i think now explains why they are single.
- It also showed that most of the customers fell within the age bracket of 15-65. However, if we were to have broken the age bin further, it would have been clear that the - age group would have fallen between 15-28 because most of the customers were students.

performing states are Maine, West Virginia,South Dakota amd North Dakota which recorded $1k sales respectively

### Demand-Supply gaps in the market:

It showed that about 64% of the customers are drinkers and enjoy drinking,butthere are relatively 32% resturant coverage for that demand.

## Conclusion and Key notable point:
- Demand-supply gap exist due to relatively low supply of alcohol.
- Non-franchise company have better rating.
- Mexican cuisine were better rated.
- Entrepreneurs seeking to explore that market need to pay attention to the non-franchise market dominance.
- Entrepreneurs can also take advantage of the demand-supply gap.


## Recommendations:

### Business opportunity:

- Restaurants that sell cuisine are restaurants that have market dominance. Therefore, anonymous A can be advised to sell cuisine.
- Restaurants that have a policy of a separate smoking section or no smoking section at all seem to be a frontline.
- With the age group (15-65) having a higher budget, it is best to focus marketing on them as they are in the best position and have the resources to buy the product/service. 

### Investment opportunity:
- It shows that the best investment decision to take is by investing in a non-franchise restaurant.
